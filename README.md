# ProfileMe

ProfileMe is a web-based platform designed to help individuals create personality-driven profiles as an alternative to traditional CVs. It connects students, job seekers, freelancers, and retirees with casual jobs, volunteering opportunities, and flexible work by providing employers with an engaging way to discover candidates.

This manual outlines the prerequisites, setup process, and steps to run the application locally.

# Project Setup

## Requirements

### Software Prerequisites
> Node.js: Version 14.x or higher (includes npm for package management).
> MySQL: Version 8.0 or higher (for the database).

### Dependencies
The project uses the following Node.js packages:
> express: Web framework for Node.js.
> mysql2: MySQL client for Node.js with promise support.
> express-session: Session management for user authentication.
> multer: Middleware for handling file uploads.
> bcrypt: Library for hashing passwords.

## Setup

### Step 1: Clone Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/annnnnne0811/ProfileMe.git
cd ProfileMe
```
### Step 2: Install Node dependencies

1. Open a terminal in the project directory
2. Run the following command to install required packages:

```
npm install express mysql2 express-session multer bcrypt
```
### Step 3: Setup database
1. Install MySQL
2. Create the Database:
    > Open your MySQL client and log in as the root user

    > Create the ProfileMe database
    ```
    CREATE DATABASE ProfileMe;
    ```
3. Import the schema file:

    > Import schema into the database
4. Update Database Configuration (if needed):
    > Open app.js and authModel.js.
    > Update the dbConfig object if your MySQL credentials differ:
    ```javascript
        const dbConfig = {
        host: 'localhost',
        user: 'root',
        password: 'your_password_here',
        database: 'ProfileMe'
    };
